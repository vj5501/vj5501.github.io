      <h2>Welcome to my Portfolio</h2>
      <p>I am a software engineer and tech enthusiast currently in my third year of computer science studies at VIIT. I have previously worked as an app developer intern at Motoverse, and have also been involved in various volunteering activities such as NSS Ganesh Visarjan, NSS blood donation, and NSS tree plantation.</p>
      <p>Some of my notable projects include the DontWait Android app for PMT officers and travellers, the FindNPark Android app for finding parking nearby, a Python book query application using an API, and the SaveMotivations web app using React, Firebase, and Bootstrap. In my free time, I enjoy learning about new technologies and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the field.</p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Please feel free to browse through my other pages to learn more about me and my work.</p>
